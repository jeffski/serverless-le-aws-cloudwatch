# Serverless le-aws-cloudwatch

---------

**Deploy the LogentriesCommunity [le-aws-cloudwatch](https://github.com/LogentriesCommunity/le-aws-cloudwatch) project
using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com). Stream AWS Lambda and other CloudWatch logs to Logentries.**

Created by the LogentriesCommunity, le-aws-cloudwatch is an AWS Lambda function written in Python that is invoked by 
CloudWatch stream events and pushes the corresponding CloudWatch logs to Logentries.

### Prerequisites

- Serverless Framework installed or available via CICD
- The token for a [token based log](https://docs.logentries.com/docs/input-token/) set up in Logentries
- The name of the log in CloudWatch to process (i.e. `/aws/lambda/my-function`)

### Deployment

Deploy le-aws-cloudwatch from the command line using arguments:

```
serverless deploy --le-region eu --le-token abcd1234 --cw-log /aws/lambda/my-function
```

Depending on your workflow you can also deploy using environment variables:

```
export LOGENTRIES_REGION=eu
export LOGENTRIES_TOKEN=abcd1234
export CLOUDWATCH_LOG=/aws/lambda/my-function

serverless deploy
```

#### Options

| Argument    | Environment Variable | Description |
| ---         | ---                  | ---         |
| `le-region` | `LOGENTRIES_REGION`  | The Logentries account region, currently only **eu** |
| `le-token`  | `LOGENTRIES_TOKEN`   | The log token generated by Logentries that will be streamed to |
| `cw-log`    | `CLOUDWATCH_LOG`     | The Cloudwatch log to stream to Logentries |


### Working with Multiple CloudWatch Logs

As it is highly likely that you will want to process multiple CloudWatch logs we recommend using the name of
the CloudWatch log file as the stage argument from the command line:

```
serverless deploy --le-region eu --le-token abcd1234 --cw-log /aws/lambda/my-function --stage my-function
```

The stage name must be unique for each function and environment.
